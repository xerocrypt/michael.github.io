				<h2>Aikido</h2>
				<img src="images/welsh-aikido-society.jpg" width="150px"></br></br>
				A martial art that was developed from an older martial art called 'Aiki-jutsu'. Aikido can be a method of learning self-defence or to improve fitness and relaxation. There are numerous health benefits, for people of all ages, abilities and levels of fitness.</br>
				A concept that is central to Aikido is that of 'Aiki', which is essentially about being in a state of relaxation and co-ordination to achieve movement with maximum efficiency. Junior grades develop Aiki through the repetition of nine core techniques, and at senior level, we apply these dynamically to attack and defence.</br></br>

				<h2>History of Aikido</h2>
				Aikido has its origins with an earlier martial art, Daito-ryu Aiki-jutsu, that was being taught around the beginning of the 20th century by Takeda Sokaku. Among Takeda's best students was Morihei Ueshiba, who initially taught his version of Aiki-jutsu before it became known as Aikido in 1942. There is evidence that Ueshiba studied and incorporated things from other martial arts, such as the sword techniques and movements of the Kashima Shinto-ryu.</br></br>
				
				Aikido was brought to the United Kingdom sometime in the 1950s, and it seems the first British group practiced at 'The Hut' dojo under Kenshiro Abe. In the 1970s, Ken Williams went to train with an independent group that was already practisig Aikido in Wales. After a while, Williams went to practice with Koichi Tohei, selling us Kenshiro Abe's katana to fund the trip. Williams there discovered a new, different and better way of mastering Aikido, and he brought back the teachings to Mal Saunders.</br>
				In the 1990s, there was a split from Williams' organisation, and the Welsh Aikido Society was established and registered with the British Aikido Board.</br></br>

				<h2>Class Structure (for Kyu Grades)</h2>
				Though there isn't a set class structure, training sessions for kyu grades normally takes the following format:</br>
				<ul>
					<li>Stretching - you'll learn new ways of stretching the joints. This makes it easier to handle the techniques, and improves flexibility.</li>
					<li>Rolling and breakfalls (beginners only).</li>
					<li>Demonstration and practice of a movement or part of a technique. These are put together into a technique.</li>
					<li>Techniques: These are simply a syllabus, a vehicle for developing Aiki. We practice the demonstrated technique multiple times.</li>
					<li>Randori or more usually projections and throws. This is about applying what we learned from techniques in free-form and dynamic movements.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Krav Maga</h2>
				<img src="images/kontakt-kombat.png" width="150px"></br></br>
				Curently training under Gareth Noble, who has extensive experience. At one point training under Geoff Thompson. Krav Maga is a good self-defence school with which to supplement traditional martial arts training.</br></br>
				Krav Maga should be an excellent way of supplementing classical martial arts training, if the aim is to develop self-defence abilities, by adding an element of realism and unpredictability, and it provides an opportunity to improve fitness also. Krav Maga isn't a martial art as such, but a regime of developing awareness, mindset and preparation for the application of techniques in real-world situations.
