      <h2>Test Automation</h2>
      I have delivered a test automation capability based on C# and the Microsoft Coded UI Test libraries. Regression tests that previously required several weeks when done manually were completed within a matter of hours. We also managed to use Test Manager so recordings of manual regression tests could be converted to C# code and modified as required.

      <h2>Web Services</h2>
      Used for passing of data between several nationally-deployed clinical systems. The Web Service architecture followed the SOLID principles of software design, being loosely coupled across five layers:
      <ul>
        <li>API repository</li>
        <li>Web Service helpers</li>
        <li>Data access: Data response</li>
        <li>Data access: Data response body</li>
        <li>Data access: Data response items</li>
      </ul>

      Testing and debugging was performed using SoapUI.

      <h2>Messaging Dashboard</h2>
      Uses:
      <ul>
        <li>ASP.NET MVC 5</li>
        <li>Entity Framework</li>
        <li>Service Broker and Stored Procedures</li>
      </ul>

      The Messaging Dashboard interprets and displays the contents of Service Broker's error and duplicate message queues. It provides database administrators to quickly determine the cause of message processing failures.</br>
      Selected messages could be deleted, resubmitted or moved between Service Broker queues.

      <h2>Messaging Metrics Dashboard</h2>
      This ASP.NET MVC 5 application displays graphs showing the number of messages processed by a) Total Message Volume, b) Messages by Organisation, and c) Messages by Type.</br>
      The application works from an Entity Framework model that includes the stored procedures and data objects sent/returned. The stored procedures are called by Web API controllers that return JSON responses to the View layer. In the View layer, JavaScript charts are rendered from the JSON response data.</br>
      Uses:
      <ul>
        <li>ASP.NET MVC 5</li>
        <li>Entity Framework</li>
        <li>amCharts and Chart.js</li>
      </ul>
