        <h1>Agile</h1>

       <div id="article">
            Without using management-speak or convoluted terminology, I'll try and explain Agile development as clearly as I can. Agile is basically the way most development teams work these days - it is a way for teams to communicate, distribute work and manage workloads.
            Many of our tools and techniques come from this, for example, Application Lifecycle Management, Kanban boards and Scrum meetings.</br></br>

            Agile came about in 2001, with the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. What needs to be understood is that Agile came about in the contexts of other methods that arose during the 1990s and were inflexible to the way developers actually work.</br>
            The point of Agile is to not get bogged down into the minutae of a process. It also recognises that conditions and requirements often change during the development lifecycle.</br></br>

            Agile was proposed as a more flexible and adaptive method, which emphasises people and communication above processes, adaptiveness above fixed plans, and working software above heavy documentation.

            <h2>User Stories</h2>
            A term commonly encountered, a 'user story' represents a feature to be implemented in a software product. Setting out the user stories of a software product is a method of breaking down the development into increments (AGILE ALLIANCE, 2015).

            <h2>Scrum</h2>
            A good introduction to the Agile methodology, this is a way for those involved in development (not necessarily just the developers) to communicate progress, changes in the plan and next steps.</br></br>

            Officially there are only three defined roles in Scrum: Product Owner, Team and Scrum Master.</br></br>

            The most common type of Scrum meetings encountered are the 15-minute standup, the Sprint Planning and Sprint Review. Often they involve developers, senior developers and test analysts.
