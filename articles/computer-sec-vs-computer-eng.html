<h1>Computer Security vs. Computer Engineering</h1>

<div id="article">
First off, when the news reports claim a shortage of qualified professional, but what is meant by 'qualified'?</br></br>

The first problem is there isn't really an entry level vast majority of security jobs being advertised require about 10 years' experience in whatever area of IT. Plus, in the my workplace, security is handled by experienced developers and systems administrators - it doesn't make sense to hire an application security specialist who isn't versed in software engineering and testing, or a database security specialist who isn't experienced in SQL. It's therefore unlikely that a security graduate would go straight into a computer security job or start a career in security straight off, for several years. You'd need several years' experience in software development, systems administration or the service desk before you're able to do the security.</br>
In fact, most my fellow graduates seemed to have started out on the service desk.</br></br>

The problem is the industry doesn't like specialists. By that, I mean that IT professionals these days are expected to be multi-skilled. For that, you'd need to come out of university with a range of programming languages, plus the skills to administrate SQL databases and servers. You're not going to get this through a computer security programme, and if you did study computer security, you'd be competing with the computer engineering graduates.</br>
What computer security students should be doing is looking at job descriptions during their first year, finding out what skills are actually in demand and building those skills.</br></br>

<h2>Differences Between Computer Engineering and Computer Security</h2>
I'd say that a computer engineering/science degree is more transferrable simply because computer security is a more specialist area.</br></br>

What a 'cyber security' degree won't do is make the student an elite hacker, which requires a fairly advanced level of computing skill anyway.</br></br>

What a computer engineering degree teaches is several programming languages and networking and database development. These are the core skills that IT professionals are expected to have.</br></br>

One thing the computer security course did teach that's useful is systems administration using the command line.</br></br>

Unfortunately a computer security undergraduate also is faced with the task of learning the engineering behind that also. Why are certain services running on a machine? Why are certain things appearing in Wireshark?</br></br>

A lot of undergraduates had problems grasping network engineering theory, and it was technically possible to graduate without having done any coding. Entire modules were dedicated to security policies, cryptology and 'cyber' crime. In comparison, the computer engineering graduates had learned several programming languages, plus networking plus more in-depth studies of the operating system.
This is important because the technologies you work with in the real world are very different to what you're working with as an undergraduate. You can learn the security aspect on the job.</br></br>

As it turned out, the most valuable skill I learned was systems administration in the command line. If you're already studying a computer security degree, I strongly recommend cultivating a generic skill such as programming, systems administration or networking. You'd want to graduate with a few software projects and maybe a CCNA to show off.

<b>Why I wouldn't</b></br>
Job security, basically. If it's so difficult to find work in the security field, how difficult would it be to progress your career and find another job in the case of redundancy?</br>
I always want to be in a job in which I'm developing and maintaining transferrable skills.</br></br>
