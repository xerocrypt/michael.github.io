<h1>Computer Security vs. Computer Engineering</h1>

<div id="article">
Looking back, I don't actually regret completing a computer security degree. I studied at a great university, had excellent lecturers, I really enjoyed the course and wouldn't have studied anything else. The thing is computer security graduates weren't really in demand, and I found it very difficult to find work in the computer security industry, despite having graduated with a Distinction and having run a startup while a sudent. I was dismayed to find that almost all the vacancies in 'cyber' security were for senior positions and required 5+ years' experience.</br>
In fact, if I hadn't dedicated so much time to improving my programming skills, I wouldn't have a decent career in software development.

But aren't we constantly being told there's a shortage of 'cyber' security professionals?
The first problem is there isn't really an entry level vast majority of security jobs being advertised require about 10 years' experience in whatever area of IT. Plus, in the my workplace, security is handled by experienced developers and systems administrators - it doesn't make sense to hire an application security specialist who isn't versed in software engineering and testing, or a database security specialist who isn't experienced in SQL. It's therefore unlikely that a security graduate would go straight into a computer security job or start a career in security straight off, for several years.</br>
In fact, most my fellow graduates seemed to have started out on the service desk.</br></br>

The problem is the industry doesn't like specialists. By that, I mean that IT professionals these days are expected to be multi-skilled. For that, you'd need to come out of university with a range of programming languages, plus the skills to administrate SQL databases and servers. You're not going to get this through a computer security programme, and if you did study computer security, you'd be competing with the computer engineering graduates.</br>
What computer security students should be doing is looking at job descriptions during their first year, finding out what skills are actually in demand and building those skills.</br>

Third reason not to study computer security is it's hard to find work, and there isn't really a career path. This means there's less job security.</br>

By the time you are qualified and deemed to have the experience, you've already progressed in whatever area of IT, and you'd likely have other commitments that limit your next move.
