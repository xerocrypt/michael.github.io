<h1>Computer Security vs. Computer Engineering</h1>

<div id="article">
The first problem is the vast majority of security jobs being advertised require about 10 years' experience in whatever area of IT. Plus, in the my workplace, security is handled by experienced developers and systems administrators - it doesn't make sense to hire an application security specialist who isn't versed in software engineering and testing, or a database security specialist who isn't experienced in SQL. It's therefore unlikely that a security graduate would go straight into a computer security job or start a career in security straight off, for several years.</br></br>

The problem is the industry doesn't like specialists. By that, I mean that IT professionals these days are expected to be multi-skilled. For that, you'd need to come out of university with a range of programming languages, plus the skills to administrate SQL databases and servers. You're not going to get this through a computer security programme.</br></br>

By the time you are qualified and deemed to have the experience, you've already progressed in whatever area of IT, and you'd likely have other commitments that limit your next move.
