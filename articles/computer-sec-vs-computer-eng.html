<h1>Computer Security vs. Computer Engineering</h1>

<div id="article">
In fact, if I hadn't dedicated so much time to improving my programming skills, I wouldn't have a decent career in software development.</br></br>

In fact, most my fellow graduates seemed to have started out on the service desk.</br></br>

The problem is the industry doesn't like specialists. By that, I mean that IT professionals these days are expected to be multi-skilled. For that, you'd need to come out of university with a range of programming languages, plus the skills to administrate SQL databases and servers. You're not going to get this through a computer security programme, and if you did study computer security, you'd be competing with the computer engineering graduates.</br>
What computer security students should be doing is looking at job descriptions during their first year, finding out what skills are actually in demand and building those skills.</br></br>

Third reason not to study computer security is it's hard to find work, and there isn't really a career path. This means there's less job security.</br>
By the time you are qualified and deemed to have the experience, you've already progressed in whatever area of IT, and you'd likely have other commitments that limit your next move. For example, as a software developer, it's unikely I'd relocate or go back to doing shift work, or work in a Security Operations Centre doing essentially call centre work.
