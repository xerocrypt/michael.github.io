            <h2>Message Queue Doesn’t Appear in Entity Framework Model</h2>
            Unlike a conventional database table, a message queue in the Service Broker part of the database cannot be imported into the Entity Framework model, and Entity Framework can’t read the queue through a stored procedure either (at least not without going through a Web Service). As a workaround, in the SQL Server Management Studio, create a view for whichever message queue in the Service Broker. Next, import that view into the Entity Framework model for the application.

            <h2>Error 404: Cannot Find Resource</h2>
            In my case the problem was related to routing and the startup order of the application components. To resolve this, open the project’s properties and enter the <i>Web</i> section. Clear the <i>Specific Page</i> text box, and check the ‘<i>Current Page</i>‘ radio button.

            After doing this, the application should be able to execute in debug mode, either by right-clicking whichever <i>.cshtml</i> file and selecting ‘<i>Set As Start Page</i>‘ or ‘<i>View in Browser</i>'.</br></br>

            If the same problem persists, run the IIS Manager and ensure the application has an entry under <i>Default Sites</i> while it’s executing. In the <i>Browse for Directory</i>, find and select the location where the Visual Studio project is stored.</br></br>

            Back in the Visual Studio project’s properties, within the <i>Servers</i> section, click the <i>Create Virtual Directory</i> button, to load the virtual directory into IIS.

            <h2>CS1061: Does Not Contain Definition and no Extension Method</h2>
            As far as I can determine, the problem is a mismatch somewhere between the Model, Controller and View layers when referencing the object, and I think this happened because Visual Studio didn’t build the Controller-View ‘scaffold’ properly.</br>
            Scrap the Controller and Views for the database table/queue, and leave the Model in place. Next, create a new Controller, this time by selecting ‘<i>Add</i>‘ – ‘<i>Controller…</i>‘ instead of ‘<i>New Scaffolded Item…</i>‘, and as before, select the ‘<i>MVC 5 Controller with with views, using Entity Framework</i>‘.</br></br>

            This time, double-check the ‘<i>Reference script libraries</i>‘ option is not selected, and leave the ‘<i>Use a layout page</i>‘ field is blank.
