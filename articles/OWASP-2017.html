        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#1: Injection</h2>
            Section covers various application and database injection flaws, the underlying prolem essentially being that untrusted instructions/data are sent to an interpreter.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#2: Broken Authentication and Session Management</h2>
            Features handling authentication and session management can be incorrectly implemented.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
            XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without
            proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user supplied data using a
            browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s
            browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#4: Broken Access Control</h2>
            Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. Attackers
            can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other
            users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#5: Security Misconfiguration</h2>
            Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application,
            frameworks, application server, web server, database server, platform, etc. Secure settings
            should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally,
            software should be kept up to date.

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#6: Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
            Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial,
            healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit
            card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as
            encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser.
        </div>


        <div id="article">
            <h2>#7: Inadequate Attack Protection</h2>
            The majority of applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent, and respond to
            both manual and automated attacks. Attack protection goes far beyond basic input validation
            and involves automatically detecting, logging, responding, and even blocking exploit attempts.
            Application owners also need to be able to deploy patches quickly to protect against attacks.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#8: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h2>
            A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the
            victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a
            vulnerable web application. Such an attack allows the attacker to force a victim’s browser to
            generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#9: Components with Known Vulnerabilities</h2>
            Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same
            privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate
            serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known
            vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>#10: Unprotected APIs</h2>
            Modern applications often involve rich client applications and APIs, such as JavaScript in the
            browser and mobile apps, that connect to an API of some kind (SOAP/XML, REST/JSON, RPC,
            GWT, etc.). These APIs are often unprotected and contain numerous vulnerabilities.
