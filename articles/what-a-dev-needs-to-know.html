<h1>What Developers Need to Know</h1>


<article>
Back in 2003/2004, during my college days, we had a module called Internet Technologies, taught by an accomplished Web developer who made a fair amount of money. All he needed to know, and all we needed to learn, was HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</br></br>

Ten years later, in my first development job, I had to know a lot more. These days, it looks as if developers need to learn a lot more technologies than developers in the past. This was an awakening, from my undergraduate days during which I did functional programming. In fact, there are so many other considerations that a new specialisation, DevOps, became all the rage.</br></br>

<h2>Software Engineering Principles</h2>
So, what does SOLID mean? It means you need to know about 'loose coupling', abstractions, interfaces and implementations, repositories and inheritance.

<h2>SQL or Other Database Stuff</br>

<h2>Version Control</h2>
In the past, the old way of doing things was to have a designated maintainer and a changelog file.</br></br>

<h2>Server Administration</h2>
Where are you going to deploy applications to, and how do you know the application is suitable for the deployment environment?
