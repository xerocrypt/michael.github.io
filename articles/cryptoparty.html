<h1>CryptoParty: A Retrospective</h1>


<div id="article">
I can't quite remember where the CryptoParty was first mentioned, but reviving the 1990s cypherpunks movement, with events being held around the world, seemed like an excellent idea. I'm not sure whether Asher Wolfe was actually heading the movement, but she was the figurehead.</br>
As it happened, I organised and presented the first CryptoParty event in the UK, with a lot of help from someone from Cheltenam.</br></br>

Unfortunately shit happened in late-December. Asher Wolfe had some kind of grievance.</br></br>

Painting us all with that brush was ridiculous and unfair. Few people are privileged enough to afford a place at the big cons, let alone get embroiled in the politics there. Most of us were simply concerned with protecting fundamental rights, and we're painfully aware that we're not approaching this problem from the perspective of living under a repressive regime.</br>
We were also painfully aware that our attendees weren't diverse - by this I mean we were essentially a dozen geeks, and I was preaching to the converted. We needed to be a voice to the public, and we made an effort to make it as open as possible.

<h2>Psudonymity is more important, probably</h2>
The immediate problem isn't government oppression here in the West. It's socially-enforced censorship and the amount of shit one gets for voicing a controversial idea.</br>
Pseudonymity is a fix for this.

<h2>Pay attention to social media</h2>
Because this is what people are using, and it comes with its own issues.
