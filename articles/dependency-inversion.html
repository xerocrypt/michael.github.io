            This states:
            <ul>
                <li>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.</li>
                <li>Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.</li>
            </ul>

            The point is to make high-level components independent of the low-level implementations. A classic example is of an application that uses a data source, but should also be capable of being adapted to use a different data source without modifying its high-level components. Someone developing the high-level components wouldn't need to know how feature are implemented at the low level.
