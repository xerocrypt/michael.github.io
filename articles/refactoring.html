        <h1>Refactoring Code</h1>

        <div id="article">
            This is a term for restructuring code without affecting its behaviour, in order to make source more readable, consistent and maintainable. This can involve the renaming and re-arranging of code.</br>
            A number of refactoring options are available in Visual Studio under the '<i>EDIT</i>' -- '<i>Refactor</i>' menu options:</br></br>

        <div id="article">
            <h2>Renaming</h2>
            To intelligently rename an object within the code. This option often appears automatically when renaming a class in Visual Studio anyway, to ensure all instances of that name are updated accordingly.

        <div id="article">
            <h2>Field Encapsulation</h2>
            Instead of accessing fields directly, methods (commonly named 'get' and 'set') are created for reading and writing to the fields. Typically a field is set as private, while the method accessing it is public. Using this technique, a programmer could limit the actions performed on the field.

        <div id="article">
            <h2>Method Extraction</h2>
            Creates a new method based on a selected section of code. Variables are detected and used as the new method's parameters. Commonly used if there's a need to break a larger method into multiple smaller methods for readability or maintainability.

        <div id="article">
            <h2>Abstract Class and Interface Conversion, or Extract Interface</h2>
            Creates  a new source file containing interface, populated with selected public members. This is useful if multiple classes have a set of members in common.

            <h2>Remove Parameters</h2>
            Remove parameter from method and its declaration.
