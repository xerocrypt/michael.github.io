            <h2>ACOS3 Smart Card</h2>
            Manufactured by ACS as a 'flexible microprocessor' card. The ACOS3 card has 32KB of EEPROM, and initially it seemed ideal for my project. As it turns out, the card functions more as a storage medium with native functionality limited to read/write operations. These operations are performed by sending machine code instructions known as Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the card.</br></br>

            Read operation:</br>
            <img src="images/APDU-read-data.png"></br></br>

            Write operation:</br>
            <img src="images/APDU-write-data.png"></br></br>

            For example, the following command:</br>
            <code>WRITE: 11 BYTES TO 00 3Ah: HELLO WORLD</code></br></br>

            Would be sent to the card as:</br>
            <code>91 00 3A 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64</code></br></br>

            So using the ACOS card would likely require the development of a custom application with its own hardware drivers. However, it's just about possible to script a series of actions using the g(scriptor) application, which is available for Linux.

            <h2>Examples from the Manufacturer's Documentation</h2>
            To perform actions with the card, I needed to consult the manufacturer's documentation.</br></br>

            Submit IC code: <code>80 20 07 00 08 41 43 4F 53 54 45 53 54</code></br></br>

            Select FF 07: <code>80 A4 00 00 02 FF 07</code></br></br>

            Write 4 bytes to ATR file: <code>80 D2 00 00 04 96 02 12 34</code></br></br>

            Get random number: <code>80 84 00 00 08</code></br>
            Create session key from random number: <code>80 82 00 00 10 [Eight bytes rnd num] [8 bytes rnd terminal num]</code></br></br>

            Submit PIN and code: <code>80 20 06 00 08 [8-byte code]</code></br>
            New PIN: 80 24 00 00 08 [PIN]</br></br>

            Get card serial number: <code>80 14 00 00 08</code></br>
            Get card revision number: <code>80 14 06 00 00</code></br>
            The last two bytes of the above two commands are status codes.</br></br>

            Get card EEPROM size: <code>80 14 05 00 00</code></br>
            The last byte of the response indicates the EEPROM size.</br></br>

            Select file: <code>80 A4 00 00 02 [2-byte file ID]</code></br>
            The Personalisation File address is 'FF 02'</br>
            The Security File is at address 'FF 03'.</br>
            The User File Management File is at address 'FF04'.</br>
            The Account File is at 'FF 05'.</br>
