<h2>ACOS3 Smart Card</h2>
The ACOS3 card has 32KB of EEPROM, and initially it seemed ideal for my project. As it turns out, the card functions more as a storage medium with native functionality limited to read/write operations. These operations are performed by sending machine code instructions known as Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the card.</br></br>

Read operation:

Write operation:

For example, the following command:
<code>WRITE: 11 BYTES TO 00 3Ah: HELLO WORLD</code></br></br>

Would be sent to the card as:
<code>91 00 3A 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64</code></br></br>

So using the ACOS card would likely require the development of a custom application with its own hardware drivers. However, it's just about possible to script a series of actions using the g(scriptor) application, which is available for Linux.</br></br>
