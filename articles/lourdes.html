			<h2>Basilica and the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes</h2>
			The Rosary Basilica is the central tourist site in Lourdes, containing the Grotte de Massabielle, the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes and the Underground Basilica. This site was actually constructed in the late-19th century, after Bernadette Soubirous encountered the apparitions of the Virgin Mary.</br>
			Although it looks quite large in the press photographs, the Basilica is actually much smaller, but there is an impressive expanse of green land just across the river from the Grotto.

			<h2>Grotte de Massabielle</h2>
			More commonly referred to as 'The Grotto' by the English-speaking visitors, this is the site where St. Bernadette encountered the Marian apparitions. At the time it was a cave within a small outcrop near the river, but later the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes was built on top of it. The spring that Bernadette uncovered provides the famed Lourdes water that is collected by almost everyone who visits.</br>
			At certain periods of the year there are long queues to enter the Grotto, and the site is no longer open after 12:00 AM.
		</div>

			<h2>Underground Basilica</h2>
			What might initially appear a concrent-lined pit is actually a well-designed underground basilica decorated with artwork and pictures of saints around the perimeter. Off to the side is a small chapel containing relics of John Paul II and other saints. The International Mass is celebrated here every Wednesday at 09:00, although you'd need to arrive much earlier to get a seat.

			<h2>Chemin de Croix</h2>
			This is the Stations of the Cross on a steep hill next to the Basilica. It was actually the Franciscan Order who were behind the idea of outdoor Stations of the Cross, and also the Nativity Scene, as it happens.</br>
			Descending the hill after the final Station of the Cross, the Pic du Jer can be seen clearly, along with much of the Pyrenees mountain range.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Lower Stations</h2>
			In addition to the upper stations, there are the lower Stations of the Cross just several hundred metres from the candle area.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Torchlit Marian Procession</h2>
			At 21:00 each evening, formations of various groups meet at the Basilica to join a torchlit procession, which lasts for about 90 minutes. It's really not as busy as the press photographs indicate during the summer. At 23:00 there is apparently a midnight Mass, though most people disperse to enjoy other things the Basilica has to offer while it's relatively quiet.
		</div>

			<h2>Chateau Fort de Lourdes</h2>
			Strategically built on an outcrop at the centre of Lourdes, the early parts of this fortress were constructed during the 8th century. Apart from the tower that overlooks the Basilica and some of the closer mountain ranges, things to see here include a small museum distributed throughout the building with various historical exhibits. Entry is about 7 Euros.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Pyrenees Mountains</h2>
			A cycle path that passes under the roundabout near the Pic Du Jer will take you deeper into the Pyrenees countryside, where you can get rather impressive views of the nearby mountain ranges. The path runs along a predefined cycling trail. The snow-covered peaks in the distance mark the border between France and Spain.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Pic du Jer</h2>
			The mountain that overshadows Lourdes to the south is the Pic du Jer. For 12 Euros one can buy a return ticket for the rail car to the upper station (it climbs roughly 2,000 metres), which is a short walk from the summit. Alternatively, the mountain can be climbed in approximately 90 minutes by following the footpath. From the summit the whole of Lourdes and most the Pyrenees range to the south can be viewed.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Night Life</h2>
			The night life is surprisingly active in Lourdes until 01:30 in the morning. Drinks cost around 5 Euro for a pint, and about 6 Euro for a double JD and Coke. There are also a couple of 'Irish' bars near the town's centre.
