			<h2>Basilica and the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes</h2>
			The Basilica is the main tourist site in Lourdes, containing the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes, the Grotte de Massabielle, the Underground Basilica and several other places. This site was actually constructed in the late-19th century, after St. Bernadette was alleged to have encountered the apparition.</br>
			Actually the Basilica ap[pears much smaller than it does in photographs, and it's overshadowed by the Pic du Jer and the mountain peaks behind the Notre Dame.
		</div>

			<h2>Grotte de Massabielle</h2>
			More commonly referred to as 'The Grotto' by the English-speaking visitors, this is the site where St. Bernadette encountered the Marian apparitions. At the time it was a cave within a small outcrop near the river, but later the Sanctuaires Notre Dame de Lourdes was built on top of it. The spring that Bernadette uncovered provides the famed Lourdes water that is collected by almost everyone who visits.</br>
			At certain periods of the year there are long queues to enter the Grotto, and the site is no longer open after 12:00 AM.
		</div>

			<h2>Underground Basilica</h2>
			What might initially appear a concrent-lined pit is actually a well-designed underground basilica decorated with artwork and pictures of saints around the perimeter. Off to the side is a small chapel containing relics of John Paul II and other saints. The International Mass is celebrated here every Wednesday at 09:00, although you'd need to arrive much earlier to get a seat.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Chemin de Croix</h2>
			This is the Stations of the Cross on a steep hill next to the Basilica. It was actually the Franciscan Order who were behind the idea of outdoor Stations of the Cross, and also the Nativity Scene, as it happens.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Lower Stations</h2>
			In addition to the upper stations, there are the lower Stations of the Cross just several hundred metres from the candle area.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Torchlit Marian Procession</h2>
			At 21:00 each evening, formations of various groups meet at the Basilica to join a torchlit procession, which lasts for about 90 minutes. It's really not as busy as the press photographs indicate during the summer. At 23:00 there is apparently a midnight Mass, though most people disperse to enjoy other things the Basilica has to offer while it's relatively quiet.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Chateau Fort de Lourdes</h2>
			Strategically built on an outcrop at the centre of Lourdes, the early parts of this fortress were constructed during the 8th century. Apart from the tower that overlooks the Basilica and some of the closer mountain ranges, things to see here include a small museum distributed throughout the building with various historical exhibits. Entry is about 7 Euros.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Pyrenees Mountains</h2>
			A cycle path that passes under the roundabout near the Pic Du Jer will take you deeper into the Pyrenees countryside, where you can get rather impressive views of the nearby mountain ranges. The path runs along a predefined cycling trail. The snow-covered peaks in the distance mark the border between France and Spain.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Pic du Jer</h2>
			The mountain that overshadows Lourdes to the south is the Pic du Jer, and the summit is accessible by taking a cable car to the top, along a 2,000 metre track, or through a long ascending footpath that takes roughly an hour to complete.
		</div>
		
		<div id="article">
			<h2>Night Life</h2>
			The night life is surprisingly active in Lourdes until 01:30 in the morning. Drinks cost around 5 Euro for a pint, and about 6 Euro for a double JD and Coke. There are also a couple of 'Irish' bars near the town's centre.
