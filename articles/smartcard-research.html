<h2>ACOS3 Smart Card</h2>
The ACOS3 card has 32KB of EEPROM, and initially it seemed ideal for my project. As it turns out, the card functions more as a storage medium with native functionality limited to read/write operations. These operations are performed by sending machine code instructions known as Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the card.</br></br>

Read operation:

Write operation:
<img src="images/APDU-write-data.png"></br></br>

For example, the following command:
<code>WRITE: 11 BYTES TO 00 3Ah: HELLO WORLD</code></br></br>

Would be sent to the card as:
<code>91 00 3A 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64</code></br></br>

So using the ACOS card would likely require the development of a custom application with its own hardware drivers. However, it's just about possible to script a series of actions using the g(scriptor) application, which is available for Linux.

<h2>OpenPGP Cryptographic Key Storage</h2>
The second set of kit I acquired was for storage and use of conventional OpenPGP keys, with the SCR3500 reader chosen for portability.
<ul>
<li>ZeitControl BasicCard ZC5.4</li>
<li>Identive SCR3500</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="article">
<h2>BasicCard ZC5.4 Smart Card</h2>
Has 16KB EEPROM and limited processor functions. The card is programmable and customisable to some degree, using the ZeitControl BasicCard development software. This seems more promising for the storage and use of OpenPGP keys, though I've yet to test this.
