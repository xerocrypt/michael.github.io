            <h1>Turing's Cathedral (Notes)</h1>
        </div>

        <div id="article">
            Authored by George Dyson, this is the story of the team of engineers around John von Neumann, and their efforts to construct the world's first general purpose computer. It's the story of how the von Neumann architecture today's computers are based on came into existence. The book contains many photographs and trivia I haven't come across before. This is the lesser-known story of what followed Alan Turing's efforts during the war.</br>
            Sure, we learn (and usually soon forget) about the von Neumann architecture at university, but how was it first implemented? Why did von Neumann think it was a practical design?

            <h2>Before the War</h2>
            The story actually began in the 17th century, if not before then. Mathematicians theorised about the idea of encoding and communicating information as bits. Then we have Claude Shannon's information theory of entropy. Basically information can be encoded and communicated as bits. A set of bits invariant in space is code or communication. Bits invariant in type but spatially fixed is memory or stored data. This is actually a much older area of thought, dating back as far as the 17th century, at least. Dyson does add a fair bit of history in the book, regarding the founding of Princeton University and the surrounding areas, just to set the scene.</br>
            The point is that binary was already a valid numbering system, with which arithmetic could be performed and all that. Binary digits could also be converted to denary and back to binary. This is bleeding obvious, but it must have given birth to the idea that an electrical system of switches could perform arithmetic operations.

            <h2>Computing's Role in Mechanised Warfare</h2>
            But the story here began in the closing years of World War I, as the US military brought mathematicians together to improve its ballistics technology. It was a merging of two things: the ballistics research started during the Great War, and the bringing together of mathematicians for that research.</br></br>

            These mathematicians would soon join the privately-funded Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS).</br></br>

            Dyson does tend to go through the history a little too much - do we really need the life story of everyone involved in the founding of the IAS? And it isn't until we get to the fifth chapter - well into the book, that Dyson started his explanation of the engineering behind the first general purpose computer, named 'MANIAC'.

            <h2>Components and Engineering of the First General Purpose Computer</h2>       
            The next stage of the story is Alan Turing's theory that any program stored on paper tape could be executed by a mechanical or electrical system. A general purpose computer, in other words. So, that's what von Neumann's team attempted to build.

            But the bulk of the account happened during the ten years following World War II, as von Neumann's team went about this with electronic components, applying what they learned about developing technology during the war. They faced a problem: how do they store and encode bits of information using analogue electronic components?
            My personal observation is that every invention is really a synthesis of previous ideas. Engineers were already using vaccuum tubes, and were able to use them to display information by coating their surfaces with phosphor and manipulating elecromagnetic fields to direct beams of electrons - basically the cathode ray tube.
            Observing that the dot on the phosphor coating would remain temporarily after voltage was removed, the engineers figured that dividing the coating into an addressable 32x32 array would be a method of storing data electronically. This was the genesis of Random Access Memory, if not a full working computer. This was MANIAC, the predecessor to ENIAC.

            Next they needed to design analogue circuits that gave only two possible outputs, or two possible distinct ranges of output, to represent 1 and 0.

            Then from that they needed a core component that performed arithemtic operations with binary input and output. This was actually developed during WWII also, in the form of the Computron.
