<div id="article">
If the SOLID principles of software design are followed, each module in the software should perform a single, well-defined function, and therefore the output of each module could be predicted with certainty given known inputs. We could then create unit tests.</br>
It's commonly argued that one should create unit tests for each module before coding the module itself.

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
In my very humble opinion, this is an ineffecient approach. Not only is the developer producing (at least) twice the amount of code,  a unit test method must have more complexity than the module being tested.
