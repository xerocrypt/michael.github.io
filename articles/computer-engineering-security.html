        <h1>Computer Engineering or Computer Security?</h1>

        <div id="article">
            As well as rebranding itself the 'National Cyber Security Academy', the university at Newport has an interesting approach to addressing what's commonly held to be an INFOSEC 'skills gap'. The '<a href="http://www.southwales.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-applied-cyber-security/">Applied Cyber Security</a>' degree is more vocational and supposedly provides students with at least some experience of the real-world environments. The more <a href="http://www.southwales.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-computer-security/">conventional academic programme</a> is somewhat more demanding than the one I studied several years ago. And, of course, there are the computer engineering programmes also.</br></br>

            Should one study computer engineering or computer security as a degree subject, though? As someone who opted for a security degree programme, excelled at it, attended numerous interviews over the course of 18 months and actually did security/forensic jobs on the side, I argue that computer engineering is actually the better option. The following are my reasons.

        <div id="article">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            First of all, when the news reports a shortage of 'qualified' candidates, what exactly is meant by 'qualified'? We only need to look at the job postings to see the vast majority of open positions are senior-level and require several years's experience in something specific. A large part of the problem is that the security field lacks an entry level and a defined career path, both of which are needed to make INFOSEC a viable career choice.  And the things is the experienced IT professionals knew far more about security in their areas than I did on graduating.</br>
            Basically security should really be considered a specialist area within the computing field, not an isolated subject.</br>

            <h2>Computer Security or Computer Engineering?</h2>
            So, given all the above, is it best to study computer security or computer engineering? There are substantial differences between the two programmes. It's a little like comparing the MCSE against the SANS GIAC.</br></br>

            Computer security is a good choice if you're already coming with a background in computing or IT - if you already have a strong foundation in computing, either through a previous degree programme or experience. It's much harder to complete a security degree programme and develop a decent foundation in computer engineering from scratch.</br></br>

            So, undergraduates will have two problems. First, it's essential to learn about the technologies. It's no good learning about obscure Linux server vulnerabilities and hardening techniques is no good if you don't understand the operating system internals. It's pointless writing about code vulnerabilities if you haven't developed software and tried some reverse engineering. And they do ask questions about these in technical interviews. An understanding of the technologies is far more important than learning the pen testing tools - learning how to break into a system with the right tools is pretty easy to learn later.</br>
            Computer security graduates will also find themselves competing with computer engineering/science graduates for more generic IT positions to begin with.</br></br>

            The other problem is computer security programmes (especially the certifications) teach primarily security first, knowledge that was traditionally a byproduct of technical expertise. Genuine hackers are motivated by the need to learn how things work. Developing the required level of expertise across such a broad area isn't a trivial task. Normally it's recommended that undergraduates put in around 37 hours per week study. I was putting in roughly 18 hours a day on average.</br></br>
